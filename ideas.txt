Make ; a postfix expression so `identifier;` can behave just like `=;`. I think currently ';' does not resolve to a postfix expression.

Nil_Construct? Ruby has NilClass.

Importing other code by retrieving them from whatever scope they're in. For example, rng := .../Random.new.
Or Random := .../Random.
