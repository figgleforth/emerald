Make ; a postfix expression so `identifier;` can behave just like `=;`. I think currently ';' does not resolve to a postfix expression.

Some kind of Nil construct? Ruby has NilClass.

Importing other code by retrieving them from whatever scope they're in. For example, rng := .../Random.new, Local_Math := .../Math, etc.

Scope could extend Hash instead of having a @hash attribute, that would be less work for me, I think.

Shorthand literals.
@(1, 2, 3) could create Vector literals, and infer dimension based on number of expressions.
#(abc 123) -> Hash {abc: nil, 123: nil} and if abc is defined locally, it should take its value too.
%(this is a set)
?(abc def) returns true if all truthy
$(one two) strings
:(one two) symbols
