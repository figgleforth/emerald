#### Features I want
1. As few reserved words as possible — `class`, `def`, `self`, etc
2. Prefix, infix, postfix, and circumfix operators — `!1`, `2+3`, `4!`, `|5|`, respectively
3. Custom operators — `5 @#$ 6`, `7 by 8`, `11:22pm`, etc
4. Web app functionality — server, controllers, models, and views

[/lang](./lang) contains the source code. Folders beginning in underscores are placeholders or various forms of stubs for what I want to implement.

[/test.rb](./test.rb) shows how to parse the main readme.txt as source code.
