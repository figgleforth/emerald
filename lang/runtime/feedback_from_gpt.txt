Your code is solid but has some areas that could be improved for clarity, maintainability, and potential optimizations. Here’s my feedback:

1. Clarity and Readability
	•	Consistent Naming: Some method names like command and block_call are a bit vague. Consider renaming command to something more descriptive like evaluate_command.
	•	Documentation: While you have some comments, they could be clearer. Adding structured inline documentation (e.g., @param and @return for all methods) would help readability.

2. Scoping and References
	•	Reference Management: Your reference handling through Reference.new and references[ref.id] is interesting, but I would double-check if references are properly cleaned up to avoid memory bloat.
	•	Scope Handling:
	•	You’re using push_scope and pop_scope extensively. It might be worth implementing a helper method that ensures a scope is popped even if an error occurs (e.g., begin...ensure pop_scope).
	•	Instead of manually handling class scope merging with curr_scope.merge!, consider enforcing a strict inheritance mechanism (perhaps using delegation or explicit super calls).

3. Class Composition Logic
	•	Operator-Based Composition: Your support for >, +, and - in class composition is intriguing, but it might benefit from a more structured pattern, like trait-based mixins or explicit delegation instead of copying scopes.
	•	Error Handling in Composition: If an unknown operator is encountered, you raise an error—but it might be useful to provide more debugging information, such as the full class hierarchy or composition chain.

4. Function Invocation
	•	Handling of Arguments in call_expr and block_call
	•	You’re zipping block.parameters with args and handling defaults manually. Consider extracting this logic into a resolve_arguments helper function.
	•	The way you’re processing default values (set par.name, run(par.default)) is good, but does it correctly handle cases where default is a function or another expression?

5. Control Flow and Evaluation
	•	while_expr Handling:
	•	Right now, it seems like you run expr.when_false only if expr.when_true never executes (output.nil?). But what if you want a fallback behavior that isn’t tied to output? Consider refactoring that logic.
	•	Return Handling in Function Execution:
	•	Right now, you’re checking if last.is_a? Return_Expr, but you also handle it.is_a? Return_Expr separately. It might be better to standardize return value handling across different execution paths.

6. Debugging and Commands
	•	Breakpoint Handling: Your >~ command looks interesting. If this is meant to be an interactive REPL breakpoint, consider adding support for introspection (ls, ls! already exist) and variable modification in-place.
	•	Logging (>!, >!!, >!!!)
	•	Your ANSI coloring approach for logging is a nice touch. You could abstract the coloring logic into a helper method to reduce repetition.

Overall Thoughts

Your approach is well-structured and flexible, but there are opportunities for improvement in:
	1.	Error Handling: Provide better debugging output when something fails (especially in function calls and class composition).
	2.	Encapsulation: Consider extracting some logic (argument resolution, scope management) into helper functions for clarity.
	3.	Performance Considerations: Avoid unnecessary deep copies of scopes and ensure reference tracking is efficient.
