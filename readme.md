# Emerald

A for-fun programming language with random mechanics I like.
```bash
$ bundle install 
$ bundle exec rake test
```
Take a look at the [interpreter tests](./test/interpreter_test.rb) for an idea of the syntax and overall progress. And [
`src/helper#interp_file`](./src/helper.rb) to learn how to run your own `.e` source files.
