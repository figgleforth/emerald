# Emerald

A for-fun programming language with random mechanics I like. Take a look at the [interpreter tests](./test/interpreter_test.rb) for an idea of the syntax and overall progress.
```bash
$ bundle install 
$ bundle exec rake test
# Finished in 0.306965s, 443.0473 runs/s, 2208.7209 assertions/s.
# 136 runs, 678 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skips
```
