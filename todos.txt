Collect errors and keep interpreting the program if possible. Then dump all errors once the program can't run any longer.

Clean up usage of temporarily_push_scope v add_to_stack. I don't think using one or the other is preferred, I just don't want to use both.

Interpreter#interp_string only handles non-interpolated strings.

Split Interpreter#interp_infix into multiple functions.

Currently @compositions and @expressions are separated in a Type_Decl, they should be treated as one. I can special case them later if I need to.

Improve Praser#precedence_for, get rid of that nested array format.

Clean up Parser#parse_conditional_expr. It should just loop until curr?(end) right? It works as is for now, but it's ugly.

Separate preload.e types into their own separate .e files, and be able to reference them. That's currently not possible.

Custom test helpers like assert_operator(out), assert_type(:operator, out). I don't have a preference for either, but it's needed. :lexeme_type_helper.

Interpreter#interp_dot_infix :extract_instance_creation for all instances. Right now this only contains the Number instance.

Closures. There's one skipped test in interpreter_test.rb until closures are implemented.

While loops. Currently it treats while expressions as if expressions. :while_loops

When an assert is triggered, print out the actual *_Expr.

Rake tasks for running tests. I'm using RubyMine but it would help others.

Parsing `Identifier {;}` should raise a syntax error or something, because that's not valid syntax. Currently it loops indefinitely. I know where it happens, I just need to fix it. See :Identifier_function

Expression `x:=4, y:=2, { x y }` interprets but doesn't capture the existing x and y declarations, and yields an empty dictionary with keys x and y.
