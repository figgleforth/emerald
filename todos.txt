assert() `Unhandled_Expr: nil when no args are given. This seems the most urgent.

You can use any Type identifier when declaring a type and it won't crash, even when the identifier is made up. That might seem like a bug, and it is. But what if it only crashes when you actually assign? `some: Thing` will just set {some: nil} in the scope. So it could remain a placeholder until assignment.

Clean up usage of temporarily_push_scope v add_to_stack. I don't think using one or the other is preferred, I just don't want to use both.

Interpreter#interp_string only handles non-interpolated strings.

Split Interpreter#interp_infix into multiple functions.

Currently @compositions and @expressions are separated in a Type_Decl, they should be treated as one. I can special case them later if I need to.

Improve Praser#precedence_for, get rid of that nested array format.

Clean up Parser#parse_conditional_expr. It should just loop until curr?(end) right? It works as is for now, but it's ugly.

Separate preload.e types into their own separate .e files, and be able to reference them. That's currently not possible.

Custom test helpers like assert_operator(out), assert_type(:operator, out). I don't have a preference for either, but it's needed. :lexeme_type_helper.

Interpreter#interp_dot_infix :extract_instance_creation for all instances. Right now this only contains the Number instance.

Closures. There's one skipped test in interpreter_test.rb until closures are implemented.
Also related, the expression `x:=4, y:=2, { x y }` interprets but doesn't capture the existing x and y declarations, and yields an empty dictionary with keys x and y.

While loops. Currently it treats while expressions as if expressions. :while_loops

When an assert is triggered, print out the actual *_Expr.

Rake tasks for running tests. I'm using RubyMine but it would help others.

Parsing `Identifier {;}` should raise a syntax error or something, because that's not valid syntax. Currently it loops indefinitely. I know where it happens, I just need to fix it. See :Identifier_function

Stress test error collecting. I haven't done that yet at all.

Cannot_Initialize_Undeclared_Identifier was removed because

*_Expr classes have :start_location, :end_location defined, but this is never set. Being able to print relevant code in the output would reduce confusion with errors.
